This is a backend service written in ElysiaJS for a webapp to generate schedules from Mindbox using a tool I created
as a source:
[Mindscrap tool](https://github.com/NexWan/MindScrap)

This backend service will contain the following endpoints:

- Fetch semesters from a Json
- Generate schedules automatically

And pretty much it lol
